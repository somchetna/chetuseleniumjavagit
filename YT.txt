​ @LISAesthetic @Yash Talawadekar Sᴜʜᴀɴᴀ ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ @Wilson Correa  Hello dumb BTS and anime watchers! Wanna hear an amazing fact? I bet you will!! So what mango boi made the fact that youtubers don't really care what they are posting becuase they know their fans and audience will appreciate it.. And guess what it same appears with mango boi.. He makes 3-4 points and facts which are absoulutely right and I totally agree.. But  to criticize any youtuber more and make his video more longer he makes more 10-11 facts which are truly untrue and just a pile of shit.. and his arrogant i mean "Mature" audience rely on it blindly and spam it in the whole comments lol.. And anyone close to @MangoBoi, pls show this to him... BTW people would now reply that a 9 year old kid in comments lol... well I ain't a triggu stan or a 9 y.o.. well this was just an opinion, so See ya! well i wanted to tell this too that, These BTS army and the dumb Anime watchers are the first class copy of Tiktokers.. And i love BTS, but not it's fans duh!
